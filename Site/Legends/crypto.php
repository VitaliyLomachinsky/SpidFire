          Crypto's specialty is secrets. This ingenious hacker and encryption master uses his aerial drones to spy on opponents in the Apex arena while staying in the shadows. He also has a secret of his own: his name is Tae Joon Park, and he was taken to the Apex Games to find people whose efforts he was falsely accused of murder.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">Orphaned early, abandoned by everyone, Tae Joon escaped poverty by becoming a computer systems engineer for the Mercenary Syndicate, along with his adoptive sister Mila Alexander. While researching the Apex Games software, Tae Joon and Mila stumbled upon a hidden algorithm capable of predicting the outcome of any Apex match. This caught the attention of the wrong people, and the next day Mila disappeared, and Tae Jun had to go to the bottom of the trumped-up charges of murdering her. Now he has become part of the Games in order to regain his good name. Sometimes there is no better way to become invisible than to be in the spotlight.</p>

          When Lobe was nine, the simulacrum killer Revenant killed her family, and she could only watch. Having lost everything, Loba became a pickpocket to make ends meet. She improved her skills and used any means to escape from hopeless poverty. Everything changed when she infiltrated a secret facility that was considered impregnable and obtained a jump movement module. With a new teleporting bracelet, even the most unthinkable trophies were suddenly at arm's length for her. As well as her dreams of life in high society.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">A rumor has spread throughout the Outer Lands: if you want something valuable, but it is well guarded, contact Loba. She almost managed to part with her past. But with the appearance of Revenant at the Games, it subjugated her future. In a desperate attempt to kill him, Loba blew up an entire underground complex full of Revenant's bodies, simultaneously bringing down the City of Skulls and the Dome of Thunder. But she soon learned that it was just one of many similar vaults hidden throughout the Frontier. Now she herself became a part of the Games in order to end her enemy forever. In addition, the Apex arenas are simply teeming with treasures that are just asking for in hand. </p>

          <p class="page__paragraph">Her vengeance will be accomplished if luck does not turn away from her. In the meantime, you can do all these cute knick-knacks.</p>

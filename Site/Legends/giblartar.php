          Gibraltar is a meek giant that has a wild side as well. The son of PSAU (Search and Rescue Consolation Association) volunteers, he has always been adept at getting others out of the dangerous situations that are common in the Outlands. However, he realized the cost of protecting others only after he stole his father's motorcycle for entertainment with his boyfriend and fell into a powerful mudflow. His parents managed to save him, but because of this, his father lost his hand. Gibraltar has not forgotten his feat and devoted his whole life to helping those who need it.</p>

          <p class="page__paragraph">The Apex games did not change its purpose, but changed its meaning. Many of Gibraltar's friends and colleagues have competed in the Games for money and fame over the years, but some have never returned home. Gibraltar went to the Games to keep them safe. For the first time, his lifeguard skills and rebellious nature found a common ground. Now he is the legend of the Apex Games. On the line of fire, he covers the squad with himself, and rivals, seeing him, scatter in search of cover.</p>

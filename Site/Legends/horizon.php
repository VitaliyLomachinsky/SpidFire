          Almost a century ago, the Outer Lands were teetering on the brink of a catastrophic energy crisis. Finding a solution was entrusted to Dr. Mary Somers, a charmingly eccentric astrophysicist. Mary moved with her family to a research station on Olympus and set to work.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">With the help of her apprentice Dr. Reid, Mary discovered the brantium, an element she was convinced could be the key to unlimited energy. But Brantium is found only on the accretion disk of a black hole, so Mary and Dr. Reed set out on a dangerous mission to prove the truth of her theory.</p>

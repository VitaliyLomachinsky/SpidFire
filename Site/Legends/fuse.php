          Lover of women, his bro for men and just a Man with a capital letter. Fuze is a whole subversive team rolled into one ... which he himself knows very well. This cheerful demolition man is loaded with explosives from head to toe with irrepressible enthusiasm. Fuse has enough confidence, but not very planning. He was used to blowing everything up first, and only then asking questions, and never mind getting involved in another mess.</p>

          <p class="page__paragraph">Fuse grew up on Salvo, a brutal planet ruled by alternating eccentric dictators who focus on smashing, killing and having a good time. For most of his life, Fuze served as a mercenary along with childhood friend Maggie. But while she aspired to become one of the strongest dictators of Salvo, Fyusa beckoned to the arena. He found his calling in Salvo's bloody sport - the Bone Cage. Over time, he managed to become the best, most charismatic and beloved gladiator on the planet. But he still wanted to perform on the greatest stage in the universe: the Apex Games. But while Salvo remained part of an independent space, this dream was not destined to come true. However, after Salvo joined the syndicate, Fuse had a chance. For which he had to pay - Maggie did not let Fuze just pick up and leave.</p>

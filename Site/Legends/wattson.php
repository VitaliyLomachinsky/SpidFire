          Natalie Wattson Packett is well known in the Apex Games, but for slightly different reasons than most fighters. As the daughter of the Games' chief electrical engineer, she studied the mysteries of energy flows in order to spend more time with her father, but soon found her calling. Her lively mind was constantly jumping from one object to another, but electricity always "grounded" it. Electric current obeyed understandable inviolable laws, unlike the rest of the world.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">She dug into any technical literature she could find, and gradually became one of the best engineers in her field. The construction of the Modified Restraint Ring for the Apex Games was the pinnacle of her career. Unfortunately, her father died on the day the project was completed. Natalie was left alone. A detachment of fighters saved her from complete despair, who invited her to return to the arena already as one of them, assuring that she would always have a home there. Now Wattson and his comrades fight in the arena, which she helped to build: destroys explosive projectiles, charges shields, creates barriers and mutes the noise of battle when the general turmoil becomes unbearably loud. No one knows more about the arena than Wattson. Those who underestimate her are in for an extremely painful surprise.</p>

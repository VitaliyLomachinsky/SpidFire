          Revenant was once a man. The Syndicate's hit man, the best of the best. He looked in the mirror and saw his human face in it. But time spares nothing, and when his program finally crashed, he realized what Hammond Robotics and the Mercenary Syndicate had turned him into: a waking nightmare made of steel and remnants of flesh. Its owners revived their faithful simulacrum, over and over again pulling death out of the embrace, and the program made him forget about everything.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">He vowed to hunt down everyone who was involved in his rebirth. But since then more than two hundred years have passed, and none of them are alive anymore ... At least, so it seemed to him. The return of the Hammond Robotics to the Outer Lands has rekindled his thirst for revenge, and he will not stop until he slaughters everyone who has even the slightest relation to the corporation. However, if he comes across a couple of legends, he will gladly cut them to shreds. He once needed a reason to kill ... but a lot has changed in him since then."</p>

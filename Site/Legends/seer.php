          Even before his birth, it was predicted that Ciar would bring only pain and suffering to the world, and on the night he was born, a flying meteor split the sky and hit the moon of his home planet. This was considered a bad omen, therefore, when Obi Edolashim opened his light blue eyes, his entourage saw only evil fate in the child.

          <p class="page__paragraph">At first, the public didn't take him seriously. But over time, with each victory, the strength inside him grew, and with it his power in the arena. And when the fame of him began to go ahead of him, a strange thing happened ... Those from the public who were oppressed, expelled and forgotten saw a particle of themselves in Ciara. Soon, crowds of people came to watch him fight and proclaim Ciara their champion. Now this arena legend is already flying to the Apex Games, and there is no one who has not heard his name. The young man, born under a bad omen and with a frightening myth, curbed his legend and created an even greater one. He is Ciar, the idol of the exiled, outcast and frankly peculiar.</p>

          In the Outer Lands, Bloodhound is known as 
          one of the greatest hunters in the entire Frontier. 
          The child of two engineers sent to the New Beginning 
          plant on Talos was taken to his home by Uncle Arthur when 
          a terrible disaster destroyed the complex and cut the lives 
          of his parents. Arthur taught old customs - a belief system that
           praises nature and rejects modern technology. Yet Bloodhound was
            irresistibly drawn to mechanical miracles. In the end, this passion,
             combining the old and the new, defeated Goliath, who had long hunted
              the inhabitants of their village, after which the path of the orphan
               changed forever.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">Bloodhound's unrivaled tracker skills will give any team an edge. With their help, you can find hidden rivals and track the movements of the enemy. Appealing to the ancient earthly gods of the North, Bloodhound believes that fate is already a predetermined path that invariably leads to death. But with this knowledge comes strength, for Bloodhound knows: until the fateful day comes, the hunter cannot be stopped.</p>

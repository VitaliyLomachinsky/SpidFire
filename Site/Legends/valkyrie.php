          Brave, daring, ardent and ferocious Kairi Imahara does not hesitate to give bribes and break the law. As a child, she stole the Titan. It belonged to her father, a pilot with the callsign "Gyurza". She wanted to be like a father when she grew up. But one day he went on a mission and never returned. In a sense, she still followed in his footsteps - however, she did not control the Titan, but the ship. But that was enough to ensure a decent life for himself. But her personal life was not worthy in any way. During the day she smuggled precious cargo, and at night she hobnobbed with criminals and mercenaries. And although she had no shortage of partners, alcohol and the sky, she was still consumed by the desire to find the one who killed her father - his commander Kuben Blisk.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">She tracked down Blisk and was ready to kill him. But he spoke respectfully of her father - and invited her to get better. She fired anyway. But it didnâ€™t take his life. It was enough for her to know that his life was in her power. And yet she took something from him - the Apex Games card.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">Kairi decided to transform the entire core of Gyurza's Nordstar flight into a sleek jetpack with which she intended to pay tribute to her father's memory. So she was finally able to soar into the air on her own terms ... in a kind of version of her father's Titan, which, as a result, still departed to her.</p>

          <p class="page__paragraph">In the months following the Battle of Gridiron, the Hestia, with Anita and her brother Jackson aboard, was attacked by unknown foes. A bomb explosion on the outside of the hull tore off a piece of the ship ... however, Jackson managed to close his sister, sacrificing his life to save her. Anita could only watch helplessly as Jackson was dragged into the cosmic abyss. After crash-landing on the planet of the Syndicate, Anita began looking for work and a brother, in whose death she refused to believe, in order to begin her journey home - a journey long decades. Now she fights in the Apex Games to raise money and try to find a pilot who is ready to take an incredible journey and take her to her home, to the remaining family members.</p>

          The Pathfinder is a model of optimism no matter the circumstances. MRVN - Mobile robotic all-purpose companion, configured for reconnaissance and terrain survey. It turned on several decades ago in an abandoned warehouse, having no idea who created it and why. Knowing nothing but his MRVN classification, Pathfinder eventually set out in search of his creator.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">Since then, Pathfinder has learned a lot in his travels (for example, how to cook cheesy leviathan stew in the oriental way), but he never came close to finding the creator. However, he still does not give up hope. At the Apex Games, he expects to find supporters ... and eventually gain the attention of his creator. He remains enthusiastic, always ready to help and make new friends (and then shoot them).</p>

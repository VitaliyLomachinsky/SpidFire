          Alexander Knox was once one of the most prominent scientists at Humbert Labs, the leading manufacturer of Frontier pesticide gases. Knox worked day and night, devising new formulas for the ever-increasing volumes of supplies needed to protect crops and secure the Outer Lands. But he soon realized that approved testing methods were an obstacle to his scientific work. He needed experiments not only on tissue samples: he needed living organisms.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">Knox led his development in secret and over time began to see the beauty in his works and their ability to destroy everything with which they come in contact. But soon the head of Humbert Labs learned about his terrible experiments. After their conversation, a fire started in the laboratory. Now, participating in the Apex Games under the name Caustic, he tests his gas creations in the arena and watches them with interest.</p>

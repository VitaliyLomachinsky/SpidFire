          Rafe is a whirlwind fighter 
            capable of carrying out deadly attacks as well as
             manipulating space-time, creating rifts in the fabric
              of reality. But these opportunities cost her dearly.
               A few years ago, she woke up in the IMC with no 
               memory of her life. Senior Science Pilot Rene Blazy,
                who volunteered for her own experiments ... 
                who was betrayed and thrown into a cell ...
                 disappeared. There was only a timid girl, 
                 frightened by the incessant cacophony of voices
                  in her head, until another copy of her appeared 
                  and taught her to listen attentively. Following
                   her example, Rafe found the strength to break 
                   out of prison and escape into another reality 
                   - this reality.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">Finally free, but still devoid of memories, Rafe
             continues on her way, hoping to find out who she was
              before the experiments. Many Apex Games are held 
              at old IMC bases, and Rafe battles among the 
              legends to get to these research centers - and 
              the secrets of his past. Now at the Games it has
               its own, and with each match it comes closer to 
               the truth ...</p>

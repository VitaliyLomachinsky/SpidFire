          Rampart is a hard-working owner of her own business, who needs a large cannon and a full backpack of spare parts to survive in the dangerous and wild world of the Outlands. Before opening her popular mod shop on Gaea, Ramya Parekh (or simply Rampart) made a splash in clandestine battles. Parekh reached the pinnacle of success by relying on her combat skills and her own modified equipment. She began to receive orders from a wide variety of clients, from small smugglers to the Syndicate. They began to say that your iron is rubbish, if it does not say "Rampart".</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">Parekh never missed an opportunity to brag about her work and ridicule the efforts of others. Perhaps that is why one night a gang of thugs dropped in to her store. Her entire enterprise burned to the ground, and she herself was left with nothing ... except for the Apex card. For Parekh it was not just an invitation - it was a sign that although she lost her workshop, she did not lose her skill. In the words of her motto, she is one of those who can always "make a candy out of shit."</p>

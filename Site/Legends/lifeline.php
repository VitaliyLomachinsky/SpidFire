          Ajay Che, aka Lifeline, is not the person you'd expect to see at the Apex Games. The daughter of wealthy military speculators, she ran away from home after learning about the harm done to her family and enrolled in the Frontier Corps, a charitable organization that helps troubled settlements on the Frontier. Since then, her entire life has been devoted to caring for others, and she participates in the Apex Games to win funds for the Frontier Corps.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page__paragraph">Since there are no innocent lambs among the participants of the Games (everyone knew what they were signing up for!), And her every victory helps those in need, Lifeline takes part in a bloody show without remorse. At least that's what she tells herself. Lifeline may seem cynical and callous, but deep in her soul she wants to help people and make the world a better place. And if for this you have to kill a couple of people - so be it.</p>
